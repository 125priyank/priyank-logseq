- ARM (Advanced RISC machine): RISC(Reduced instruction set arch)
	- Number of instructions (arm7): 650
	- If I buy a license I get
	  collapsed:: true
		- Processor design files
		  collapsed:: true
			- You will receive access to the design files for the processor, which may include Verilog or VHDL code, schematics, and layout files. These files will provide the foundation for your processor design.
		- Documentation
		  collapsed:: true
			- ARM will provide documentation that describes the processor architecture and how to integrate it into your own design. This documentation will include information on the instruction set architecture (ISA), memory mapping, and other features of the processor.
		- Software development tools
		  collapsed:: true
			- ARM provides a range of software development tools, such as compilers, debuggers, and simulation tools, that can be used to develop software for your processor.
		- Technical support
		  collapsed:: true
			- ARM provides technical support to its licensees, which can include assistance with processor integration, software development, and other issues.
	- After getting a license from ARM each company does
	  collapsed:: true
		- Study the processor architecture
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would study the processor architecture and the related documentation provided by the licensor, to understand the specific features, functionality, and  of the .
		- Develop the processor design
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would use  (HDLs) like Verilog or  to develop a processor design that is customized to their specific requirements. This involves creating a  (RTL) model, which is a detailed description of the processor design at the gate level.
		- Verify the processor design
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would use  to verify the processor design, by analyzing the  and testing various scenarios to ensure that the processor behaves as expected.
		- Synthesize and optimize the design
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would use  to convert the RTL model into a gate-, which can be used to program the hardware devices that will form the processor. The design would also be optimized to meet specific requirements such as performance, power consumption, and size.
		- Implement the processor
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would use  (EDA) tools to implement the processor design on a , which involves creating a  and using a  to manufacture the chip.
		- Test and debug the processor
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would test and debug the processor to ensure that it meets the specified performance and . This involves testing the processor under various conditions and using  to identify and fix any issues.
		- Develop software for the processor
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would develop software, such as device drivers, , and operating systems, that can run on the processor and interact with other hardware components.
		- Market and sell the processor
		  collapsed:: true
			- The processor company would market and sell the processor to customers, such as electronics manufacturers, who will integrate the processor into their own products.
		- Overall, creating a processor involves a complex and multi- that requires expertise in various areas such as , simulation, verification, software development, and marketing.
- Intel
	- Design its own x86 based (CISC) Complex Instruction set arch
	  collapsed:: true
		- x86_64 has around : 1000 instructions
		  collapsed:: true
			- The large number of instructions in x86 can make it more complex and difficult to optimize for performance, but it also provides a wide range of capabilities and flexibility for software developers.
	- i3 vs i5 vs i7 vs i9
	  collapsed:: true
		- Varying level of performance and features
		- i3 -> 2-4 cores, lower clock speed
		- i5 -> 4-6 cores, hyper threading, turbo boost (boost clock speed)
		- i7 -> 6-8 cores, high clock speed
		- i9 -> upto 18 cores, very high clock speed, AI computing
- AMD
	- Uses x86 from intel (gets license)
